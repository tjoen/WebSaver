	Internet Explorer 10  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie

	Please check out "Readme.txt" files especially one in "Build" directory.

FAQ

	Q: Example, please!
	A: "Build" directory -> Launch "build_sample.bat" -> No errors -> Launch "sample.scr".
	
	Q: Gimme moar!
	A: "Build" directory -> Launch "build_examples.bat" -> No errors -> Check "Examples" directory for .scr files.
	
	Q: How to create screensaver from scratch?
	A: Prepare your screensaver source files directory. Top level "index.html" file is mandatory. It could also include related web content (javascript, css, images), user-friendly screensaver caption ("caption.txt") and icon ("icon.ico"). Then open command prompt -> cd to "Build" directory -> build_screensaver.bat screensaver_source_directory output_screensaver_filename. Or just drag & drop your directory to "build_screensaver.bat" and enter output screensaver file path.
	
	Q: Do I need all these files to create screensavers?
	A: No, you just need "ScrGen.exe" from "Binaries" directory. But you won't be able to drag & drop your content to it.
	
	Q: How to install screensaver?
	A: You should have administrative privileges to make it available for everyone. Then place it into system32 directory (Win+R -> %windir%\system32). You can also right click -> install screensaver just for you.
	
	Q: How to uninstall it?
	A: Just choose another screensaver and delete related .scr file from system32 directory.

Advanced FAQ

	Q: Why I'm getting security warning popups on my page?
	A: Add <!-- saved from url=(0016)http://localhost --> after <!DOCTYPE html> node (you're using this one, right?).

	Q: My web page get rendered in wrong browser mode or document mode. Any ideas?
	A: Make sure that your html <head> node contains <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> at the very beginning (or after title and charset). Check HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION via regedit for DWORD 10000. The same for Wow6432Node.
	
	Q: Why preview of my screensaver is so ugly?
	A: There is no scaling of web page on screensaver module side. You can try to add such logic in web content javascript.
	
	Q: Why there are no settings?
	A: Which settings? :)

Developers FAQ

	Q: Why .NET Framework 4.5?
	A: ScrGen packs content into zip archive to store embed it as resource. I don't want to use 3rd party assembly or use something like DeflateStream. The same about new .NET features.
	
	Q: Why IE10?
	A: There is no easy way to use WebKit for such small project. I'm even didn't used 3rd party libraries. IE10 was chosen for common-sense reason. I can disable IE10 restriction and you'll be able to use previous versions of IE but... Well, you know. Yes, it uses IE ActiveX inside.
	
	Q: Will it work on another platforms?
	A: Probably no. It uses much of Win32 API to handle resources, windows, user input, etc. You can try it yourself.
	
	Q: Why so much P/Invoke, byte-level ops, inheriting, error handling, no xml comments and other crazy stuff? Why not X?
	A: I supposed this will be enough for such tiny project. Because it's fun, why else?
	
	Q: I want cool feature X!
	A: Just fork it.
	
	Q: License?
	A: MIT.
